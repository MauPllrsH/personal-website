        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a recent graduate of St. Edward's University in Computer Science. I'm really passionate about learning and at the time of this writing, Ethical Hacking.
          I'm currently pursuing a career as a Penetration Tester, but I'm also interested in Software Development.
          I was almost a professional soccer player, and then almost a professional Esports player, but I decided to pursue a career in technology instead.
          Currently I'm pursuing the HackTheBox CPTS certification, once I have that, I will be pursuing the OSCP certification.
          On top of that, I'm also learning how to code in C++, and trying to climb the ranks of both HackTheBox and LeetCode.

        <h3>St. Edward's University Varsity <span style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>(2021-2025)</span></h3>
        <p>
          I was a part of the Call of Duty team for the school. We participated in multiple national 
          competitions and consistently placed between Top 6 and 4 for the three years the team was active.
        </p>
        <h3>North American Amateur Circuit (Challengers) <span style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>(2018-2024)</span></h3>
        <p>
          While I was in college, I also played in the North American Amateur Circuit (Challengers) 
          for Call of Duty. I started playing competitive Call of Duty when I was 16 years old,
          and I have been playing for 7 years now. I have played in multiple amateur tournaments,
          and I have been a part of multiple teams. 
          <br />
          My most notable achievement was when I placed 2nd in the
          North American Amateur Circuit (Challengers) Elite tournament in 2022. The Elite tournament
          was an online tournament with a prize pool of $10,000.
